When using Docker on a Windows machine, you may need to make adjustments to the `docker-compose.yml` file to ensure compatibility with Windows file paths. Specifically, for volume mappings, Windows paths should be formatted properly. Here's the updated configuration:

### Updated `docker-compose.yml` for Windows

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  zookeeper:
    image: confluentinc/cp-zookeeper:7.5.0
    container_name: zookeeper
    ports:
      - "2181:2181"
    environment:
      ZOOKEEPER_CLIENT_PORT: 2181
      ZOOKEEPER_TICK_TIME: 2000
    volumes:
      # Adjust path for Windows compatibility
      - ./zookeeper_data:/var/lib/zookeeper

  kafka:
    image: confluentinc/cp-kafka:7.5.0
    container_name: kafka
    ports:
      - "9092:9092"
    environment:
      KAFKA_BROKER_ID: 1
      KAFKA_ZOOKEEPER_CONNECT: zookeeper:2181
      KAFKA_ADVERTISED_LISTENERS: PLAINTEXT://localhost:9092
      KAFKA_OFFSETS_TOPIC_REPLICATION_FACTOR: 1
    depends_on:
      - zookeeper
    volumes:
      # Adjust path for Windows compatibility
      - ./kafka_data:/var/lib/kafka

volumes:
  # Volumes are declared here but mapped to host paths above for Windows compatibility
```

---

### Key Changes for Windows:
1. **Relative Paths**:
   - The volumes are now mapped to relative paths (`./zookeeper_data` and `./kafka_data`) in the current directory. This avoids issues with absolute paths on Windows.
   - These folders will be created in the same directory as your `docker-compose.yml`.

2. **Avoiding Docker-Specific Volume Names**:
   - By directly mapping to local folders, the volumes are visible and manageable on your Windows file system.

### Additional Notes for Windows Users:
1. **Ensure Docker Has Access to Your Drive**:
   - Open Docker Desktop settings.
   - Go to **Resources > File Sharing** and ensure the drive containing your project is shared with Docker.

2. **Line-Endings**:
   - Ensure your `docker-compose.yml` uses Unix-style line endings (`LF`). If you encounter issues, convert the file in your editor (e.g., VS Code or Notepad++).

3. **Permissions**:
   - Docker on Windows uses a virtualized Linux environment. Ensure that permissions on the shared folders are not restricted.

---

### Steps:
1. Create the folders:
   ```bash
   mkdir zookeeper_data kafka_data
   ```
   Or create them manually in the same directory as your `docker-compose.yml`.

2. Start the environment:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

3. To clean up data:
   Just delete the `zookeeper_data` and `kafka_data` directories.
