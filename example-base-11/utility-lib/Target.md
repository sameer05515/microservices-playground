# Project Aims

The `utility-lib` project aims to provide a versatile and comprehensive utility library for JavaScript, offering a set of tools and functions that simplify common tasks in development. The library is designed to be highly modular and flexible, catering to both CommonJS and ES Module environments. Key aims include:

- Delivering a reliable set of utility functions for arrays, strings, and objects.
- Ensuring compatibility with both CommonJS and ES Module systems.
- Facilitating ease of use and integration in various JavaScript projects.
- Maintaining high code quality with thorough testing and documentation.

## Project Scope

### Overall Scope
