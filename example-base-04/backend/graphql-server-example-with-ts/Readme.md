## Milestones and Steps

`Milestone 1`:
- [`Step`]: [`Planned`]: Set up blank GraphQL server with TS


## Note
- I am not clear with using "@apollo/server", as the difference between "@apollo/server" and apollo-server-express is not clear.
- Closing this project and moving to 'example-base-03\backend\resume-service', which uses apollo-server-express
