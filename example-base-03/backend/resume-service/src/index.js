Purpose of this project:-
- To learn GraphQL syntax
  - src/v1 contains basic syntax, all in single file
  - src/v2 contains modularized, current implementation.
  - src/v3 contains copy of 'src/v2' currently.

We will work in src/v3 for below
  - We will first remove support for outputting raw 'processedDetails' field.
  - We will rather try to send fields of 'processedDetails' and will explicitely mention field names in 'example-base-03/backend/resume-service/src/v3/schemas/resumeSchema.js' file.
  - Also we will try to send error response, validation errors
