In Spring Boot, both `@RestController` and `@Controller` are used to define controllers that handle HTTP requests, but they serve different purposes and have some key differences.

### **Differences Between `@RestController` and `@Controller`**

| **Aspect**                | **`@RestController`**                                            | **`@Controller`**                                                 |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**               | Designed for RESTful web services, returning data (usually JSON or XML). | Used for traditional MVC controllers, typically returning views (HTML). |
| **Response Type**         | Automatically serializes objects to the response body (typically JSON or XML). | Typically returns a **view** (HTML) and can return data via `@ResponseBody` or `ModelAndView`. |
| **Usage**                 | Ideal for APIs that return data.                                | Suitable for applications that need to return HTML views (e.g., Thymeleaf, JSP). |
| **Annotations**           | Combines `@Controller` and `@ResponseBody` in one.               | Does not automatically include `@ResponseBody`. Needs `@ResponseBody` for returning JSON data. |
| **Example**               | `@RestController` automatically returns JSON or XML response.   | `@Controller` typically returns HTML views, unless `@ResponseBody` is used. |

### **Detailed Explanation**

#### **`@RestController`**
- **Purpose**: The `@RestController` annotation is a convenience annotation that is a combination of `@Controller` and `@ResponseBody`. It is used to simplify the creation of RESTful web services.
- **How It Works**: Any method in a `@RestController`-annotated class will automatically have its return value converted to JSON or XML (via `@ResponseBody`), and sent as the HTTP response body.
- **Typical Use Case**: You use `@RestController` when you are building a REST API or a web service that communicates through HTTP requests and responses, and you want to return JSON, XML, or other formats.
- **Example**:
  ```java
  @RestController
  @RequestMapping("/api")
  public class UserController {

      @GetMapping("/users")
      public List<User> getUsers() {
          return userService.getAllUsers();
      }
  }
  ```
  In this example, the `getUsers()` method will return a list of users, and Spring will automatically convert that list into a JSON response.

#### **`@Controller`**
- **Purpose**: The `@Controller` annotation is used in a traditional Spring MVC setup, where controllers handle requests and return views (such as HTML pages or other views rendered with a template engine like Thymeleaf or JSP).
- **How It Works**: Methods in a `@Controller`-annotated class usually return a `ModelAndView` or a logical view name. If you want to return JSON or other data directly from a `@Controller`, you would need to use `@ResponseBody` on the method.
- **Typical Use Case**: `@Controller` is used for web applications that need to render HTML views or use a view template engine.
- **Example**:
  ```java
  @Controller
  public class HomeController {

      @GetMapping("/home")
      public String homePage(Model model) {
          model.addAttribute("message", "Welcome to the homepage!");
          return "home"; // returns a view (home.html or home.jsp)
      }
  }
  ```
  In this example, the `homePage()` method returns the name of the view (such as `home.html`), and the data (`message`) is passed to the view for rendering.

### **When to Use Each**

- **`@RestController`**: Use it when building REST APIs, especially when you want to return data such as JSON or XML. It simplifies the process of creating RESTful services because it eliminates the need to manually annotate every method with `@ResponseBody`.
  
- **`@Controller`**: Use it when you're developing a traditional web application that returns HTML views. If you need to return data in a JSON format, you can still use `@Controller` with `@ResponseBody` or `@RestController` depending on the situation.

### **Summary**
- `@RestController` is specifically designed for RESTful APIs that return data (such as JSON) and is a shortcut for combining `@Controller` and `@ResponseBody`.
- `@Controller` is used in traditional Spring MVC applications where the controller returns views, typically HTML.
