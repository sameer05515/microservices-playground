Ensuring thread safety in a multithreaded Java application is crucial to avoid issues like data inconsistency, race conditions, and deadlocks. Here are some common techniques and best practices for achieving thread safety in Java:

### 1. **Synchronized Methods and Blocks**
   - **Synchronized Methods**: You can declare methods as `synchronized` to ensure that only one thread can execute the method at a time.
     ```java
     public synchronized void increment() {
         count++;
     }
     ```
   - **Synchronized Blocks**: For more granular control, you can use `synchronized` blocks to only synchronize part of the method, locking on a specific object.
     ```java
     private final Object lock = new Object();

     public void increment() {
         synchronized (lock) {
             count++;
         }
     }
     ```

   **When to use**: Synchronization is appropriate when multiple threads access shared data and you need to ensure that only one thread can modify the data at any given time.

### 2. **Volatile Variables**
   - Use the `volatile` keyword to ensure that a variable's value is directly read from and written to main memory. This avoids caching of variables in individual threads and ensures visibility across threads.
     ```java
     private volatile boolean isRunning = true;
     ```

   **When to use**: Use `volatile` for flags or state variables that need to be accessed by multiple threads and you want to ensure the changes are visible to all threads.

### 3. **Locks (ReentrantLock)**
   - Java provides explicit locks through the `java.util.concurrent.locks` package. `ReentrantLock` provides more flexible lock management than `synchronized` blocks or methods, such as timed locking and the ability to interrupt threads trying to acquire a lock.
     ```java
     private final ReentrantLock lock = new ReentrantLock();

     public void increment() {
         lock.lock();
         try {
             count++;
         } finally {
             lock.unlock();
         }
     }
     ```

   **When to use**: `ReentrantLock` is useful when you need more advanced locking mechanisms, such as lock timeouts, interruptible locks, or when you need to lock multiple objects.

### 4. **Atomic Variables**
   - Use atomic classes from the `java.util.concurrent.atomic` package, such as `AtomicInteger`, `AtomicLong`, `AtomicBoolean`, and `AtomicReference`. These classes provide thread-safe methods for performing operations on variables without needing explicit synchronization.
     ```java
     private AtomicInteger count = new AtomicInteger(0);

     public void increment() {
         count.incrementAndGet();
     }
     ```

   **When to use**: Use atomic variables when you need to perform simple operations (e.g., increment, compare-and-swap) on variables that are shared across threads.

### 5. **Read-Write Locks (ReentrantReadWriteLock)**
   - A `ReentrantReadWriteLock` allows multiple threads to read a shared resource concurrently, but only one thread can write to it at a time. This is useful when there are many readers and few writers.
     ```java
     private final ReentrantReadWriteLock lock = new ReentrantReadWriteLock();

     public void readData() {
         lock.readLock().lock();
         try {
             // Read data
         } finally {
             lock.readLock().unlock();
         }
     }

     public void writeData() {
         lock.writeLock().lock();
         try {
             // Write data
         } finally {
             lock.writeLock().unlock();
         }
     }
     ```

   **When to use**: Use read-write locks when you have a scenario where read operations are frequent but write operations are infrequent. It improves performance compared to simple locking.

### 6. **Thread-safe Collections**
   - Java provides several thread-safe collections in the `java.util.concurrent` package, such as `CopyOnWriteArrayList`, `ConcurrentHashMap`, and `BlockingQueue`. These collections are designed to handle concurrency internally and prevent issues like race conditions.
     ```java
     ConcurrentHashMap<String, Integer> map = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();
     map.put("key1", 1);
     ```

   **When to use**: Use these collections when you need to store and manipulate collections in a multithreaded environment without manually handling synchronization.

### 7. **ExecutorService**
   - Instead of manually managing threads, use the `ExecutorService` to manage a pool of threads for executing tasks. It provides built-in thread pooling, task scheduling, and thread management.
     ```java
     ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(4);
     executor.submit(() -> { 
         // Task logic
     });
     executor.shutdown();
     ```

   **When to use**: Use `ExecutorService` for managing concurrent tasks in a clean, efficient manner without manually creating and managing threads.

### 8. **Immutability**
   - Another effective strategy for ensuring thread safety is to make objects immutable. Immutable objects cannot be modified after they are created, thus ensuring that their state is consistent and thread-safe.
     ```java
     public final class ImmutablePoint {
         private final int x, y;

         public ImmutablePoint(int x, int y) {
             this.x = x;
             this.y = y;
         }

         public int getX() { return x; }
         public int getY() { return y; }
     }
     ```

   **When to use**: Use immutability when the object’s state doesn’t need to change after creation, which eliminates the risk of thread interference.

### 9. **Thread-local Variables**
   - The `ThreadLocal` class in Java provides thread-local variables that are isolated to individual threads. Each thread has its own copy of the variable, ensuring no thread interference.
     ```java
     private ThreadLocal<Integer> threadLocalValue = ThreadLocal.withInitial(() -> 0);

     public void increment() {
         threadLocalValue.set(threadLocalValue.get() + 1);
     }
     ```

   **When to use**: Use `ThreadLocal` when you want to store data that is specific to the current thread, avoiding the need for synchronization.

### 10. **Avoiding Deadlocks**
   - Deadlocks can occur when two or more threads wait indefinitely for each other to release resources. To avoid deadlocks:
     - Always acquire locks in a consistent order.
     - Use try-lock mechanisms with timeouts (e.g., `ReentrantLock.tryLock()`).
     - Limit the number of locks held at any one time.
     - Use a deadlock detection strategy.

   **When to use**: Be mindful of the resources each thread holds and follow best practices for avoiding deadlocks when using multiple locks.

- Use `synchronized` methods or blocks to control access to shared resources.
- Use `volatile` for variables that need to be accessed across threads.
- Utilize `ReentrantLock` for more complex synchronization scenarios.
- Use atomic variables for simple operations on shared variables.
- Opt for thread-safe collections from `java.util.concurrent`.

- Consider immutability for objects that don't need to change.
- Be cautious of deadlocks and thread contention.
