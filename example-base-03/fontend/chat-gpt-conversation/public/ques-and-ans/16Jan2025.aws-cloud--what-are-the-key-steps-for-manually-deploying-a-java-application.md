Deploying a Java application manually involves several key steps, from building the application to configuring the server and ensuring the necessary dependencies are in place. Here’s a general guide to help you through the manual deployment of a Java application.

### 1. **Prepare the Application for Deployment**

   - **Build the Java Application**:
     - Use a build tool like **Maven** or **Gradle** to package the application into a deployable artifact (e.g., a `.jar`, `.war`, or `.ear` file).
     - If using Maven, run:
       ```bash
       mvn clean install
       ```
     - For Gradle:
       ```bash
       gradle build
       ```
     - This step will generate the deployable file in the `target` or `build/libs` directory.

   - **Create a Configuration File (optional)**:
     - If your application requires configuration (e.g., database settings, external API keys), make sure to prepare the necessary configuration files (like `application.properties`, `.env`, or XML files).

### 2. **Set Up the Server Environment**

   - **Choose the Deployment Environment**:
     - Decide whether you will be deploying to a **physical server**, a **virtual machine**, or a **cloud platform** (e.g., AWS EC2, Azure).
     - Ensure that the target server has Java installed (the required JDK or JRE version).

   - **Install Java**:
     - If Java is not installed, install the required version.
     - On Linux, you can use:
       ```bash
       sudo apt update
       sudo apt install openjdk-11-jdk
       ```
     - For other systems, download and install the JDK from the [official Java website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html).

   - **Install Dependencies**:
     - If your application requires additional dependencies (e.g., databases like MySQL, libraries like Redis, or a web server like Tomcat), make sure to install and configure them on the server.

### 3. **Deploy the Application**

   - **Copy the Application Artifact**:
     - Use **SCP**, **FTP**, or **SFTP** to transfer the `.jar` or `.war` file to the server.
     - Example using SCP:
       ```bash
       scp path/to/your-app.jar user@server:/path/to/deployment/directory
       ```

   - **Configure the Application (optional)**:
     - If the application requires custom configurations (e.g., `application.properties`), ensure these files are present in the appropriate directory on the server.

   - **Set Environment Variables**:
     - Some applications may need environment variables for database connections or other services. Set them in the server's environment:
       ```bash
       export DB_URL=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/db_name
       export DB_USER=root
       ```

### 4. **Run the Application**

   - **Start the Application**:
     - If it’s a **Spring Boot** application (or similar), run the `.jar` file using the following command:
       ```bash
       java -jar your-app.jar
       ```
     - For **WAR** files, deploy them to a servlet container like **Apache Tomcat**:
       - Copy the `.war` file to the `webapps` folder of your Tomcat installation and start the Tomcat server.
       - Or, if you have a standalone application, you can run it directly using the same command as above for `.jar` files.

   - **Run as a Background Process** (optional):
     - To keep the application running in the background, use `nohup` or a similar tool:
       ```bash
       nohup java -jar your-app.jar > output.log 2>&1 &
       ```

   - **Start Services Automatically** (optional):
     - For production environments, it’s common to set up the application to start automatically on boot. On Linux systems, you can create a **systemd** service file:
       ```ini
       [Unit]
       Description=My Java Application
       After=network.target

       [Service]
       User=your-user
       ExecStart=/usr/bin/java -jar /path/to/your-app.jar
       SuccessExitStatus=143
       TimeoutStopSec=10
       Restart=always

       [Install]
       WantedBy=multi-user.target
       ```

     - Save the file as `/etc/systemd/system/my-java-app.service` and then enable it:
       ```bash
       sudo systemctl enable my-java-app
       sudo systemctl start my-java-app
       ```

### 5. **Configure Firewall and Networking**

   - **Configure Firewall**:
     - Ensure that the required ports for the application are open on the server’s firewall (e.g., port 8080 for web applications).
     - Example on Linux with UFW:
       ```bash
       sudo ufw allow 8080/tcp
       ```

   - **Configure Reverse Proxy (optional)**:
     - If your application needs to be accessed through a domain name or on a specific port, set up a reverse proxy using **Nginx** or **Apache** to forward requests from port 80 (HTTP) or 443 (HTTPS) to the application’s port (e.g., 8080).
     - Example with Nginx:
       ```nginx
       server {
           listen 80;
           server_name your-domain.com;

           location / {
               proxy_pass http://localhost:8080;
               proxy_set_header Host $host;
               proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
               proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
               proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
           }
       }
       ```

### 6. **Verify and Test the Deployment**

   - **Verify Application Logs**:
     - Check the application logs to ensure it has started properly. Common locations include:
       - `/var/log/your-app/` (if configured)
       - `nohup.out` (if using `nohup`)
       - Tomcat logs in `/logs` directory.

   - **Test Application**:
     - Open a browser or use tools like `curl` or `Postman` to test the application’s endpoint and verify it’s running.
     - Example:
       ```bash
       curl http://your-domain.com:8080
       ```

### 7. **Monitor and Maintain the Application**

   - **Set Up Monitoring**:
     - Use monitoring tools like **Prometheus**, **Grafana**, or **AWS CloudWatch** to monitor the health and performance of the application.
   
   - **Create Backups**:
     - Set up regular backups for the application and the database to ensure data is not lost.

   - **Log Management**:
     - Configure centralized logging systems like **ELK Stack** (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or **Splunk** to collect and analyze application logs.

### 8. **Rollback Plan (if necessary)**

   - **Roll Back to Previous Version**:
     - If the deployment fails or issues are encountered, revert to a previous working version by redeploying the previous `.jar` or `.war` file and restarting the application.

The key steps for manually deploying a Java application involve:
1. **Building the application** into a deployable artifact.
2. **Setting up the server environment** with the necessary dependencies, such as Java.
3. **Deploying the application** by copying the artifact and configuring it on the server.
4. **Running the application** and setting it up to run in the background or automatically on system boot.
5. **Configuring networking and firewall settings** to make the application accessible.
6. **Verifying and testing** the deployment to ensure it works correctly.
7. **Monitoring and maintaining** the application and setting up a rollback plan for potential issues.
