In Java, both `Runnable` and `Callable` are functional interfaces used to represent tasks that can be executed concurrently in separate threads. While they serve similar purposes, there are key differences between them.

### 1. **Return Type**
   - **Runnable**: 
     - The `Runnable` interface is designed for tasks that do not return any result.
     - The `run()` method of `Runnable` has no return value (i.e., it returns `void`).
   - **Callable**:
     - The `Callable` interface is designed for tasks that return a result.
     - The `call()` method of `Callable` returns a result (or throws an exception), and its return type is `T` (i.e., it can return any type of result).

   **Example**:
   - `Runnable`:
     ```java
     public class MyRunnable implements Runnable {
         @Override
         public void run() {
             System.out.println("Runnable task");
         }
     }
     ```
   - `Callable`:
     ```java
     public class MyCallable implements Callable<Integer> {
         @Override
         public Integer call() {
             return 42;
         }
     }
     ```

### 2. **Exception Handling**
   - **Runnable**: 
     - The `run()` method cannot throw any checked exceptions. It can only throw unchecked exceptions (i.e., exceptions that inherit from `RuntimeException`).
   - **Callable**: 
     - The `call()` method can throw checked exceptions, which allows for more flexibility in handling errors during task execution. This means you can use `throw` statements for exceptions like `IOException` or `SQLException` in `Callable`.

   **Example**:
   - `Runnable` (No exception handling):
     ```java
     public class MyRunnable implements Runnable {
         @Override
         public void run() {
             // Cannot throw checked exceptions
             throw new RuntimeException("Unchecked exception");
         }
     }
     ```
   - `Callable` (With exception handling):
     ```java
     public class MyCallable implements Callable<String> {
         @Override
         public String call() throws IOException {
             // Can throw checked exceptions
             if (true) throw new IOException("IO Exception occurred");
             return "Hello";
         }
     }
     ```

### 3. **Usage with ExecutorService**
   - **Runnable**:
     - `Runnable` tasks can be submitted to an `ExecutorService` using `submit()`. However, the result of the execution is not captured since `run()` returns `void`. You get a `Future<?>` object, which doesn’t return any value.
   - **Callable**:
     - `Callable` tasks can also be submitted to an `ExecutorService` using `submit()`. When you submit a `Callable`, you receive a `Future<T>` object, which contains the result returned by the `call()` method.

   **Example**:
   - Using `Runnable` with `ExecutorService`:
     ```java
     ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(1);
     executor.submit(new MyRunnable());  // Returns a Future<?>, no result.
     executor.shutdown();
     ```

   - Using `Callable` with `ExecutorService`:
     ```java
     ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(1);
     Future<Integer> future = executor.submit(new MyCallable());  // Returns a Future<Integer> with the result
     try {
         Integer result = future.get();  // Will return the result of the call method
         System.out.println("Result: " + result);
     } catch (Exception e) {
         e.printStackTrace();
     }
     executor.shutdown();
     ```

### 4. **Concurrency Control**
   - **Runnable**:
     - `Runnable` tasks are typically used when you don't need a result, and they are useful when executing simple tasks like updating UI elements or processing events.
   - **Callable**:
     - `Callable` is often used when you need the result of the task (e.g., computing a value or handling complex operations).

### Summary of Differences:

| Feature               | **Runnable**                          | **Callable**                             |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Return Type**        | `void` (does not return a result)      | Returns a result of type `T`             |
| **Exception Handling** | Cannot throw checked exceptions        | Can throw checked exceptions             |
| **Use Case**           | Tasks that do not return a result      | Tasks that need to return a result       |
| **ExecutorService**    | Submits tasks using `submit()` which returns `Future<?>` (no result) | Submits tasks using `submit()` which returns `Future<T>` (result) |

### Example Scenario:
- **Runnable**: If you want to execute a background task such as logging, updating the UI, or processing data that doesn’t require a result, use `Runnable`.
- **Callable**: If you need to compute or fetch some data and return the result to the calling thread (like fetching values from a database or performing a calculation), use `Callable`.
