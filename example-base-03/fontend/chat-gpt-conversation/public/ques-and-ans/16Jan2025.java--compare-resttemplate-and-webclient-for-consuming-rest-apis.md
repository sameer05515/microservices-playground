In Spring Boot, both `RestTemplate` and `WebClient` are used to consume REST APIs, but they differ in terms of their design, capabilities, and how they handle requests and responses. Here is a comparison of **RestTemplate** and **WebClient**:

### 1. **Overview**

- **RestTemplate**:
  - `RestTemplate` is a **synchronous** client used to consume REST APIs.
  - It has been around since Spring 3 and was the standard way to consume HTTP APIs in Spring-based applications.
  - It is now considered somewhat outdated for new projects, with the recommendation to migrate to `WebClient`.
  
- **WebClient**:
  - `WebClient` is the newer, more modern, **asynchronous** and **reactive** client introduced in Spring 5 as part of the **Spring WebFlux** module.
  - It supports both synchronous and asynchronous operations and is designed to support non-blocking I/O operations, making it a better choice for reactive applications.

### 2. **Synchronous vs Asynchronous**

- **RestTemplate**:
  - **Synchronous**: The request is made in a blocking manner. The thread is blocked while waiting for the response, which can be a performance bottleneck, especially in a high-load, I/O-bound application.
  
- **WebClient**:
  - **Asynchronous and Non-blocking**: `WebClient` can operate in a non-blocking manner, allowing the application to continue executing other tasks while waiting for the response. This is particularly useful in applications that require high concurrency and performance, such as microservices architectures or real-time systems.
  
### 3. **API Design**

- **RestTemplate**:
  - Provides methods such as `getForObject`, `postForObject`, `getForEntity`, `postForEntity`, etc.
  - The API is more traditional and simpler but less flexible for handling complex, non-blocking operations.

- **WebClient**:
  - Has a more modern, fluent API for building requests, such as `get()`, `post()`, `put()`, `delete()`, etc., and supports reactive operators like `subscribe()`, `block()`, etc.
  - `WebClient` has full support for reactive streams and can be used with other reactive libraries (like Project Reactor) for backpressure handling and efficient resource management.
  
### 4. **Thread Blocking and Performance**

- **RestTemplate**:
  - Since itâ€™s synchronous, it uses blocking I/O, which can negatively impact performance, especially for I/O-bound operations. The thread that makes the request is blocked until the response is received.

- **WebClient**:
  - By default, `WebClient` uses **non-blocking I/O**. It doesn't block the executing thread while waiting for the response, allowing better performance and scalability, especially under heavy load or when making many concurrent requests.

### 5. **Integration with Spring WebFlux**

- **RestTemplate**:
  - `RestTemplate` is not designed for integration with Spring WebFlux (which is based on reactive programming). It does not support non-blocking backpressure handling or reactive streams.

- **WebClient**:
  - `WebClient` is built for **reactive programming** and integrates seamlessly with Spring WebFlux. It supports reactive streams and non-blocking I/O operations, making it a natural choice for modern reactive applications that use Spring WebFlux.

### 6. **Error Handling**

- **RestTemplate**:
  - Error handling is typically done using `try-catch` blocks around the request and manually checking the response status code.

- **WebClient**:
  - WebClient provides a more declarative approach for handling errors, such as `.onStatus()` for checking HTTP status codes and `.onErrorMap()` for transforming exceptions. This allows you to easily handle different types of errors, including network and HTTP errors, in a functional style.

### 7. **Use Cases**

- **RestTemplate**:
  - Suitable for **simple, blocking HTTP requests** in traditional, monolithic, and synchronous Spring applications.
  - Still appropriate for applications that do not require reactive features and for legacy applications.

- **WebClient**:
  - Best for **reactive and non-blocking applications**, especially when combined with Spring WebFlux.
  - Ideal for **microservices**, applications with high concurrency or I/O-bound tasks, and when building efficient, scalable, and modern Spring Boot applications.

### 8. **Configuration**

- **RestTemplate**:
  - `RestTemplate` is generally configured through `@Configuration` or `@Bean` to set up a custom `RestTemplate` instance.
  
- **WebClient**:
  - `WebClient` is configured similarly, but it uses `WebClient.Builder` to customize and configure the client, and can be easily injected into beans.

### Example Comparison

#### **RestTemplate Example:**
```java
import org.springframework.web.client.RestTemplate;
import org.springframework.http.ResponseEntity;

public class RestTemplateExample {

    private static final String API_URL = "https://api.example.com/resource";

    public String getData() {
        RestTemplate restTemplate = new RestTemplate();
        ResponseEntity<String> response = restTemplate.getForEntity(API_URL, String.class);
        return response.getBody();
    }

    public String postData(String requestData) {
        RestTemplate restTemplate = new RestTemplate();
        return restTemplate.postForObject(API_URL, requestData, String.class);
    }
}
```

#### **WebClient Example:**
```java
import org.springframework.web.reactive.function.client.WebClient;
import org.springframework.http.HttpStatus;

public class WebClientExample {

    private static final String API_URL = "https://api.example.com/resource";

    private final WebClient webClient;

    public WebClientExample(WebClient.Builder webClientBuilder) {
        this.webClient = webClientBuilder.baseUrl(API_URL).build();
    }

    public String getData() {
        return webClient.get()
                .retrieve()
                .bodyToMono(String.class)
                .block(); // block() to wait for the response (useful in synchronous scenarios)
    }

    public String postData(String requestData) {
        return webClient.post()
                .bodyValue(requestData)
                .retrieve()
                .bodyToMono(String.class)
                .block(); // block() to wait for the response (useful in synchronous scenarios)
    }
}
```

### **Conclusion**
- **RestTemplate** is still a valid choice for simpler applications and when working in synchronous contexts or legacy systems.
- **WebClient** is the recommended choice for modern Spring Boot applications, especially when you're building a reactive application with Spring WebFlux or need non-blocking performance. It provides better scalability, better error handling, and supports both synchronous and asynchronous operations.
