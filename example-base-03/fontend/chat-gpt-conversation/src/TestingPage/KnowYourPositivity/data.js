      `
The **four phases of meta-learning** (*Collect ‚Üí Process ‚Üí Store ‚Üí Apply*) that we discussed earlier are not part of any widely recognized, formalized theory by a specific author. Instead, they are a structured approach derived from general learning and cognitive science principles, aligning with well-known frameworks like:  

1. **Bloom‚Äôs Taxonomy** ‚Äì Focuses on knowledge acquisition, understanding, and application.  
2. **The Feynman Technique** ‚Äì Emphasizes deep processing and application of knowledge.  
3. **Active Recall & Spaced Repetition** ‚Äì Effective storage and retrieval strategies.  

Many researchers and educators discuss similar learning cycles, but our **4-phase model** is a practical and intuitive way to structure self-learning. It ensures knowledge moves from passive intake (**collect**) to deep understanding (**process**), long-term retention (**store**), and real-world implementation (**apply**).
