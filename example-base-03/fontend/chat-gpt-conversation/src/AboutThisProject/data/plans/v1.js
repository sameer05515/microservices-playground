# Our Overall Plan
- We plan to:
  - [**Phase 1**]: Conduct a thorough review of the current application state:
    - Identify and document the existing functionality, gaps, and potential bugs.
    - Outline actionable areas for optimization and future enhancements.
  - Establish inter-component state management using:
    - **React Context** for lightweight scenarios.
    - A **basic Redux library** for scalable and structured state management.
  - Implement styling using:
    - **TailwindCSS** for global and utility-first styling.
    - A **module.css** approach for modular and isolated custom styles.
  - Introduce **JSON-based styling** to allow developers to:
    - Quickly adapt styles based on requirements.
    - Lay the foundation for future user-driven style customization via UI configurations.

# Our Plan for Improvement (Phase 1)
**Start Date:** 05-Jan-2025  
**End Date:** 08-Jan-2025

## Objectives:
1. **Review and Document Current State:**
   - Map out the application's current workflows and inter-component communications.
   - Identify and log bugs, inefficiencies, and usability issues.
   - Define performance bottlenecks and areas requiring code refactoring.

2. **Establish an Actionable Plan:**
   - Create a structured improvement plan with timelines.
   - Prioritize tasks for phased implementation to minimize disruptions.

3. **Enhance State Management:**
   - Begin transitioning to a **React Context-based state management system** for essential components.
   - Introduce Redux selectively for managing complex, shared states.

4. **Refactor Styling:**
   - Replace outdated or redundant styles with a **TailwindCSS**-driven approach.
   - Migrate custom styles to **module.css** for better maintainability and scalability.

5. **User Experience Enhancements:**
   - Plan for user-centric features, such as enabling style customization through JSON and preparing a framework for UI-based customization in the future.
