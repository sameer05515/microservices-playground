# Progress Tracker
- **05-Jan-2024**:
    - Today, we are starting the review of the current application state. Additionally, we are collecting an initial plan, which will be published by EOD. Development will then begin.
    - **Completed**:
        - Successfully implemented the **User Experience Enhancements** by adding \`react-router-dom\` and routing components in the application.
        - **Styling Refactor**: Completed integration of Tailwind CSS and removed inline CSS. Replaced some \`*.module.css\` styles with Tailwind utility classes.
        - **State Management**: Implemented Redux in the \`Counter\` component for state management. Redux was integrated successfully and is managing the state efficiently.
        - Ensured that all styles are responsive and refactored components for consistency in UI.
    - **In Progress**:
        - Gradually replacing other styles with Tailwind CSS in additional components.
        - Plan to continue implementing **Redux-based state management** and gradually identify other complex states that can benefit from Redux.

### Progress Tracker Summary - 06th Jan 2025

#### **Main Agenda**
- Optimizing the React application while experimenting with light/dark theme switching mechanisms.

---

### **Accomplishments**

#### **1. Theme Switching Mechanism**
- **Implemented and Explored Approaches:**
  - Moved to **custom attribute-based dark mode** for better scalability and maintenance.
  - Verified the effectiveness of Tailwind's \`darkMode: ['class', '[data-theme="dark"]']\` configuration.
  - Explored and tested the **selector strategy**, but concluded it doesn't add significant value for the current setup.
  - Reconfirmed that Tailwind classes like \`text-white\` and \`bg-gray-100\` need to be avoided for dynamic theme switching.

- **Debugging Efforts:**
  - Checked \`--bg-color\` and \`--text-color\` in the browser dev tools for validation.
  - Ensured \`data-theme\` was correctly set on the \`<html>\` element and responded as expected.

- **Outcome:**
  - Successfully demonstrated the dynamic theme switch using CSS variables.
  - Finalized the recommendation to avoid static utility classes for colors and use CSS variables instead.

---

#### **2. Component-Specific Updates**
- **AboutThisProject Component:**
  - Fixed dark mode issues by replacing static utility classes (\`bg-gray-100\`, \`text-white\`) with Tailwind variables like \`bg-base\` and \`text-base\`.
  - Added the \`prose\` class to ensure better typography handling.
  - Achieved seamless theme switching by adhering to global CSS variable usage.

- **Key Takeaway:**
  - Dynamic styling requires aligning components with the global theme strategy.

---

#### **3. Insights and Decisions**
- The Tailwind-based theme switching strategy works best with variables like \`bg-base\` and \`text-base\`.
- Avoided adding unnecessary libraries (e.g., Flowbite) for theme switching.
- Selector-based strategy offered no additional advantages compared to the custom attribute approach.
- Sticking to a simple, scalable approach: Custom attribute-based dark mode with CSS variables.

---

### **Next Steps**
1. **Continue Application Optimization:**
   - Identify and refactor other components using static Tailwind classes for colors.
   - Ensure all components adhere to the global dark mode configuration.
   
2. **Experiment Further:**
   - Test the current setup with additional themes (e.g., a "blue theme").
   - Explore lazy-loading theme-specific styles for enhanced performance.

3. **Document Learnings:**
   - Create a best practices guide for integrating dark/light modes in React applications using Tailwind CSS.

**Great job on making significant progress today! ðŸš€**

   - Added comments and standardized method/variable names across utilities.

3. **Bug Fixes:**
   - Resolved styling issues for the \`CodeCopyBtn\` hover effect in the unstable \`MDSectionV3\`.
   - Fixed \`validateDOMNesting\` warnings in React by avoiding invalid \`div\` nesting within \`p\` tags.

4. **JavaScript Snippets:**
   - Implemented a generic method to fetch 10 records from an array, including error handling and pagination support.

---

#### **Tasks In Progress:**
1. **Progress Toward Copy Button on Hover:**
   - Exploring the best approach to add a hover-based \`Copy Button\` for \`MDSectionV1\` without tampering with the core Markdown rendering logic.
   - Decided to deprioritize for now due to current project stability goals.

2. **React Component Refactoring:**
   - Evaluating unstable components like \`MDSectionV3\` to finalize improvements.
   - Future plans to revisit \`CodeCopyBtn\` integration with a cleaner UI/UX solution.

---

#### **Planned Tasks:**
1. **Finalize Copy Button Implementation:**
   - Research alternate approaches for adding a floating copy button that appears only on hover for code blocks.

2. **React Utility Library Optimization:**
   - Consider modularizing and publishing reusable utility functions like \`prepareErrorMessage\` and \`fetchCgptFileData\` as part of a utility library.

3. **Documentation:**
   - Create comprehensive documentation for \`MDSectionV1\` and related components to ensure ease of future updates and usage.

4. **Freelancing Portfolio Update:**
   - Incorporate completed components and utilities into your portfolio to showcase expertise in React, Markdown rendering, and utility design.

### **Progress Tracker for 08-Jan-2025**

Hereâ€™s a summary of the key tasks and progress based on our recent conversations:

---

#### **Tasks and Updates:**

1. **Optimization and Simplification of Context API**  
   - Optimized \`PragyamContext\` by simplifying state management and improving callback efficiency.
   - Applied best practices for \`useCallback\` to enhance performance and stability.

2. **Comparison: Find by ID vs. Find by Index**  
   - Evaluated efficiency between finding objects by \`id\` vs. by \`index\` in an array.
   - Conclusion: Finding by \`index\` is faster but less flexible compared to \`id\`.

3. **Return Value from useCallback**  
   - Confirmed that functions wrapped in \`useCallback\` can return values.
   - Discussed practical usage with examples to demonstrate real-world scenarios.

4. **Calling One \`useCallback\` Function from Another**  
   - Verified that one \`useCallback\` function can safely invoke another.
   - Highlighted use cases for chaining callbacks, especially in asynchronous workflows.

5. **Sample Component for Arbitrary Names with Responsive Styling**  
   - Created a responsive component using Tailwind CSS to display 100 arbitrary names in a scrollable list.
   - Ensured that the scroller respects screen size and prevents overflow.

6. **Enhancement of JSON File Selector Component**  
   - Applied Tailwind CSS for styling and improved UI/UX consistency.
   - Added responsive design elements and removed inline styles for maintainability.

7. **Alignment of Styles Across Components**  
   - Synced styles of \`ConvNamesListSectionV2\` with \`PragyamDashboardV2\` for uniformity.
   - Leveraged Tailwind CSS to standardize designs across all related components.

---

#### **Pending/Upcoming Tasks:**

1. **Finalize Context Bug Fix for Sidebar Toggle**  
   - Investigate and resolve the bug causing the sidebar to fail to reappear after being hidden.

2. **Further Enhancements to \`PragyamDashboardV2\`**  
   - Explore modularizing additional functionalities to improve maintainability.

3. **Evaluate Additional Performance Optimizations**  
   - Investigate memoization opportunities and potential use of React's \`useMemo\` for computational efficiency.

---

#### **Daily Goals for 08-Jan-2025:**

1. **Debug Sidebar Toggle Issue**  
   - Root Cause Analysis (RCA) and implement a fix for the sidebar toggle bug in \`PragyamContext\`.

2. **Code Review and Cleanup**  
   - Perform a detailed review of the optimized context and callback code to ensure adherence to best practices.

3. **UI/UX Testing**
